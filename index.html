<h1>Marble</h1>
<h2>A python library to analyse residential segregation</h2>

Very few libraries exist, and most of the existing ones are built as a GIS tool.
Marble is a python library that provides the building blocks necessary to
explore and quantify residential segregation.

Why marble?

Because of marble cakes. Cities observed through the lens of residential
segregation look like marble cakes. Only, it's less yummy.
