# Emergent classes

Using the [representation](representation.md) as a measure of interaction
between classes, we can aggregate the different categories into classes based on
their mutual interaction/repulsion.

## Measures

----

### **cluster_categories** (distribution, exposure)

----

### **uncover_classes** (distribution, exposure, ci_factor=10)
