    <dt>Dissimilarity</dt>
    <dd>Compute the dissimilarity between different categories.</dd>
    <dt>Clustering</dt>
    <dd>Compute the level of geograhical clustering of the different

    This measure of exposure indicates whether the categories attract or repel one
    another.</dd>
    <dt>Emergent classes</dt> 
    <dd>Infer the class structure from the pattern of attraction/repulsion of

--------------
+ Areal units where the categories are over-represented
+ Obtain neighbourhoods by clustering areal units
